**Today's Progress**: Solved the problem on queues. Understand the objectives of the outreachy HOTOSM resusable map visualization project. 

**Thoughts**: Wasn't a very challenging problem since I solved it in O(n) instead O(1) and since it passed all of the test cases, I didn't go further. However, I have posted my doubt on the hackerrank discussions section for follow up.  

### Day 20: March 5th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on trees: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree/problem and post a list of user stories for the outreachy contribution repo. 

**Today's Progress**: Came up with a rough outline of the code. Hasn't passed any of the test cases. 

**Thoughts**: Was too lazy to pick up a book and a pencil to work out the logic. Instead tried working out the logic on the fly while coding. Was ineffective and inefficient. Spent more than required time unsucessfully. 

### Day 21: March 6th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Contribute to the HOTOSM project. 

**Today's Progress**: TOOK A BREAK. DIDN'T CODE.

**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out the trees challenge without googling. I could figure out how to traverse the tree using inOrder(L,C,R), preOrder (C,L,R) and postOrder traversal (L,R,C). However, I couldn't figure out the logic to check if it's a BST or not. Didn't contribute to HOTOSM. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty slow. Personal life affecting productivity and focus. 

### Day 23: March 8th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Finish the trees challenge on hackerRank. 

**Today's Progress**: Submitted the code but didn't use recursion. That's what will be expected in the interviews. Googled the logic.

**Today's Progress**: Implemented an algorithm to check if a given tree is BST or not using recursion. Went through a little bit of Mapbox GL. Implemented an example map visualization. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty good. However, if I can remain more focussed and for longer then I can make some significant contribution. 

### Day 26: March 11th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Making progress with my repo for HOTOSM. Solve a problem https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor/problem

### Day 29: March 15th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Problem on Tries: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-contacts/problem

**Today's Progress**: Did something to swtich it up and gain back some enthu. I tried automating the task of sending messages on whatsapp using Python. I just implemented an already available code. But in the process, I ran into quite a bit of errors and working through them felt like an accomplishment since I spent about 2 hours on it.  Also solved a challenge related to JS.

**Thoughts**: Ofcourse, the routine of just solving problems in python is getting to me. However, I was also a bit intimidated by the increasing level of difficulty. So that's the real reason that I am bailing on HackerRank CTCI. 

### Day 30: March 16th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Set up the chrome extension with authentication and database with user information. Start brushing up C/C++. 

**Today's Progress**: Looked into a bit of information. Researched on google authentication. Had issues with Application ID.

### Day 31: March 17th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Complete the problem on Tries contacts in Python.   

**Today's Progress**: Implemented it using nesting dictionaries but got wrong counts since it was counting the number of subdictionaries instead of the number of words with the same partial. 

**Thoughts**: Debugged it for a while. Then went through discussions but in vain. Still have a mind block towards hard problems.

### Day 32: March 18th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Complete the problem on Tries contacts in Python.   

**Today's Progress**: Implemented it using nesting dictionaries but got wrong counts since it was counting the number of subdictionaries instead of the number of words with the same partial. 

**Thoughts**: Debugged it for a while. Then went through discussions but in vain. Still have a mind block towards hard problems.

### Day 33: March 19th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Figuring out how to get data points such as data created etc from the URL    

**Today's Progress**: After a lot of trial and error and research we found the WHOIS server API that produces a JSON with all of the information about the domain and it's host.  

**Thoughts**: There wasn't much of coding. It was more of understanding how HTTP requests are handled and how to access data from the api and make it dynamic.

### Day 34: March 20th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: MongoDB database setting up and learning about how to create and manipulate collections.     

**Today's Progress**: Went over the DB tutorials offered on the Udemy web development course. Implemented the examples taught. Learned how to create and manipulate collections.

**Thoughts**: This was good progress and didn't take longer than 1.5 hours to finish the tutorials, set up and play around with. I am now comfortable working with Databases in the sense that I am confident about setting up and debugging any errors in the process. 

### Day 35: March 21st, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Automate the process of generating JSON files given a list of URLs. Tries problem completion.   

**Today's Progress**: Automated generating JSON given list of URLs. Couldn't finish tries problem. 

**Thoughts**: Not happy. I am sapped out by the end of the day don't feel like sitting and solving an extra problem. 

### Day 36: March 22nd, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Tries.    

**Today's Progress**: It worked for a few test cases and timed out on the rest. Mostly coz dictionary within dictionary implementation is inefficient. 

**Thoughts**: Was happy with the progress because I sat with the problem and debugged it. 

### Day 37: March 23rd, 2018

**Today's Goal**: A challenge on HackerRank    

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a easy level problem in the CTCI track. Bit manipulation. 

**Thoughts**: It was a simple challenge that didn't take very long. The purpose was to motivate myself from not being able to solve the tries problem. 

### Day 38: March 24th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Tries.    

**Today's Progress**: Debugging and made a few changes. Erratic program behaviour.
