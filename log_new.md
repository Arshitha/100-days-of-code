**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out the trees challenge without googling. I could figure out how to traverse the tree using inOrder(L,C,R), preOrder (C,L,R) and postOrder traversal (L,R,C). However, I couldn't figure out the logic to check if it's a BST or not. Didn't contribute to HOTOSM. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty slow. Personal life affecting productivity and focus. 

### Day 23: March 8th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Finish the trees challenge on hackerRank. 

**Today's Progress**: Submitted the code but didn't use recursion. That's what will be expected in the interviews. Googled the logic.

### Day 29: March 15th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Problem on Tries: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-contacts/problem

**Today's Progress**: Did something to swtich it up and gain back some enthu. I tried automating the task of sending messages on whatsapp using Python. I just implemented an already available code. But in the process, I ran into quite a bit of errors and working through them felt like an accomplishment since I spent about 2 hours on it.  Also solved a challenge related to JS.

**Thoughts**: Ofcourse, the routine of just solving problems in python is getting to me. However, I was also a bit intimidated by the increasing level of difficulty. So that's the real reason that I am bailing on HackerRank CTCI. 

### Day 30: March 16th, 2018

### Day 32: March 18th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Complete the problem on Tries contacts in Python.   

**Today's Progress**: Implemented it using nesting dictionaries but got wrong counts since it was counting the number of subdictionaries instead of the number of words with the same partial.

**Today's Progress**: After a lot of trial and error and research we found the WHOIS server API that produces a JSON with all of the information about the domain and it's host.  

**Thoughts**: There wasn't much of coding. It was more of understanding how HTTP requests are handled and how to access data from the api and make it dynamic.

### Day 34: March 20th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: MongoDB database setting up and learning about how to create and manipulate collections.     

**Today's Progress**: Went over the DB tutorials offered on the Udemy web development course. Implemented the examples taught. Learned how to create and manipulate collections.

### Day 36: March 22nd, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Tries.    

**Today's Progress**: It worked for a few test cases and timed out on the rest. Mostly coz dictionary within dictionary implementation is inefficient. 

**Thoughts**: Was happy with the progress because I sat with the problem and debugged it. 

### Day 37: March 23rd, 2018

**Today's Goal**: A challenge on HackerRank    

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a easy level problem in the CTCI track. Bit manipulation.
