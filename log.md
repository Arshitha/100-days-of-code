# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Python HackerRank Day 14 and Day 15 challenge 

**Thoughts:** Day 14: I was trying to understand the significance of double and single underscores. Took more than required time to complete the challenge. Day 15: It was frustrating to get it to work. I was missing the key aspect of taking into account adding a node to the tail when there were more than two nodes.
