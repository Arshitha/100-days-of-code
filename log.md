# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Python HackerRank Day 14 and Day 15 challenge 

**Thoughts:** Day 14: I was trying to understand the significance of double and single underscores. Took more than required time to complete the challenge. Day 15: It was frustrating to get it to work. I was missing the key aspect of taking into account adding a node to the tail when there were more than two nodes.

**Today's Progress**: Solved the problem on queues. Understand the objectives of the outreachy HOTOSM resusable map visualization project. 

**Thoughts**: Wasn't a very challenging problem since I solved it in O(n) instead O(1) and since it passed all of the test cases, I didn't go further. However, I have posted my doubt on the hackerrank discussions section for follow up.  

### Day 20: March 5th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on trees: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree/problem and post a list of user stories for the outreachy contribution repo. 

**Today's Progress**: Came up with a rough outline of the code. Hasn't passed any of the test cases. 

**Thoughts**: Was too lazy to pick up a book and a pencil to work out the logic. Instead tried working out the logic on the fly while coding. Was ineffective and inefficient. Spent more than required time unsucessfully. 

### Day 21: March 6th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Contribute to the HOTOSM project. 

**Today's Progress**: TOOK A BREAK. DIDN'T CODE.

**Today's Progress**: Tried to figure out the trees challenge without googling. I could figure out how to traverse the tree using inOrder(L,C,R), preOrder (C,L,R) and postOrder traversal (L,R,C). However, I couldn't figure out the logic to check if it's a BST or not. Didn't contribute to HOTOSM. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty slow. Personal life affecting productivity and focus. 

### Day 23: March 8th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Finish the trees challenge on hackerRank. 

**Today's Progress**: Submitted the code but didn't use recursion. That's what will be expected in the interviews. Googled the logic.

**Thoughts**: Unfocussed. Need to work on more problems. 

### Day 25: March 10th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Understand MapboxGL and make a list of testable user stories. Figure more efficient algorithms for BST checking.  

**Today's Progress**: Implemented an algorithm to check if a given tree is BST or not using recursion. Went through a little bit of Mapbox GL. Implemented an example map visualization. 

**Thoughts**: Pretty good. However, if I can remain more focussed and for longer then I can make some significant contribution. 

### Day 26: March 11th, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Making progress with my repo for HOTOSM. Solve a problem https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor/problem
