# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Python HackerRank Day 14 and Day 15 challenge 

**Thoughts:** Day 14: I was trying to understand the significance of double and single underscores. Took more than required time to complete the challenge. Day 15: It was frustrating to get it to work. I was missing the key aspect of taking into account adding a node to the tail when there were more than two nodes.

## Restarting 100 days of code

### Day 0: January 22, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Review Data structures and algorithms concepts

**Today's Progress**: Runtime analysis. Solved 10 Examples on Big-O notation from cracking from the coding interview.

**Thoughts**: It helped fill gaps in my understanding of analysing runtime of algorithms. Need to increase solving speed.

## Restarting 100 days of code

### Day 1: January 28, 2018

**Today's Goal** : Solve 15 problems from cracking the coding interview. One hacker rank python challenge. 

**Today's Progress**: Completed 10 problems in cracking the coding interview.  Finally completed the Day 17 python challenge on exceptions. 

**Thoughts**: Taking a long time. Low confidence in the final answer that I arrive at. More exceptions not fully understood. 

### Day 2: January 29, 2018

**Today's Goal**: One python challenge. 5 questions from cracking the coding interview. Learn about twitter APIs and how to use them. 

**Today's Progress**: Finished one python challenge on Hacker Rank. Researched about twitter APIs.

**Thoughts**: Implementation of stacks and queues using lists in pyhton 3. Found an elaborate article on mining twitter data using the API. Implemented the code to collect tweets given the handle. 

### Day 3: January 30, 2018

**Today's Goal** : 10 questions from cracking the coding interview. Download images given a twitter handle. 

**Today's Progress** : Did 5 problems from cracking the coding interview. Learnt how to work with APIs and Webhooks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBW_VNg4qD0

**Thoughts**: None

### Day 4:January 31, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Download images given a twitter handle. 

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded images using tweepy. Created a video from the downloaded images using ffmpeg after pre processing.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to finally get it work. 

### Day 5: February 1, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a programming problem from cracking the coding interview.

**Today's Progress**: NONE

**Thoughts**: NONE

### Day 6: February 2, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a programming problem from cracking the coding interview.

**Today's Progress**: NONE 

**Thoughts**: NONE

## Restarting 100 days of code

### Day 1: February 14, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on HackerRank. 

**Today's Progress**: Solved a Bubble sort challenge on HackerRank

**Thoughts**: It was very simple. I just started off with it for motivation.

### Day 2: February 15, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on HackerRank. This one: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort/problem

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't finish the solution since I was too tired. However, I understood the Merge Sort algorithm pseudocode and the concept of counting inversions. 

**Thoughts**: Not good enough progress. 

### Day 3: February 16, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on HackerRank. This one: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort/problem

**Today's Progress**: Implemented merge sort since Inversion Count is a modified version of merge sort. 

**Thoughts**: Good progress since I coded it by myself without using anything but the pseudocode. Debugging took a while coz of silly errors but it was fun.

### Day 4: February 17, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on HackerRank. This one: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort/problem

**Today's Progress**: Tried to modify merge sort but couldn't. So tried to coding using somebody else's code as a reference.    

**Thoughts**: More of reverse engineering than thinking by myself. Not very happy. Doesn't work for large cases. So need a re design the algorithm. 

### Day 5: February 18, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Solve a problem on HackerRank. This one: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort/problem

**Today's Progress**: Understood the code completely and tried to play around with it. Doesn't work fo large test cases.     

**Thoughts**: Not very happy. Spent an hour and half on it. Doesn't work for large cases. So need a re design the algorithm.

### Day 6: February 19, 2018

**Today's Goal**: Finish Assignment 2 of EC500. Code review, unit testing and report presentation on webpage.

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**:
